# Playbook — reuse before you rebuild

**READ THIS BEFORE WRITING NEW CODE.** Most "new" problems in this repo were
already solved once. The cost of not checking is real: the FedEx barcode
last-12-digit logic was rebuilt by chasing the symptom when
`normalizeScannedTracking` had existed for weeks — a full test cycle wasted.

How to use this file:
1. **Before building any utility, transform, or parser**, `grep` the codebase
   for the concept AND skim the table below. Prefer extending an existing
   helper over writing a parallel one.
2. **When you solve something non-obvious**, add a one-line row here pointing at
   the file. This file is the index; the code is the source of truth.
3. Cross-link: each domain doc (below) links back here; this links to them.

## Reusable logic — check here first

| Need | Use this (don't rebuild) | Lesson |
|------|--------------------------|--------|
| Barcode scan → clean tracking # | `normalizeScannedTracking` — `src/lib/tracking/normalize.ts` | FedEx label's big barcode is a 34-digit "96" string; the tracking # is the last 12 digits. Run **every** scanned tracking value through it. |
| Free-text lab name → scraper portal | `normalizeLabName` / `sameLab` / `probeKeyForLab` — `src/lib/scrapers/normalize-lab.ts` | Staff type "Access Custom", "Vibrant · EBOO". Match on the canonical portal, never raw string equality. |
| Display a case's lab + panel | `labelForCase` / `panelFor` — `src/lib/labs/label.ts` | Zenoti multi-panel tests store `lab_name="Vibrant"`, `lab_panel=null`; the panel lives in `zenoti_service_name`. Recover it for display. |
| Records portal (all labs by all patients) | `/labs/records` page + `listRecordsCases` — `src/app/labs/actions.ts` | Read-only history grouped by patient (active + archived, excludes deleted). Reuses the `listLabCases` q/lab/since clauses, `getColumnFor`+`COLUMN_LABEL` for status, `labelForCase`. PHASE 2 (not built): backfill pre-tracker PB/Zenoti orders (June 2025→now) that never became a `lab_case` — via Import CSV or a PB/Zenoti history reader. |
| Zenoti service → lab_name (+panel) | `resolveLabName` — `worker/src/zenoti/lab-mapping.ts` | "Labs - X" prefix triggers a case; canonical map first, token-split fallback. (TODO: also return the panel.) |
| Zenoti "IV -" service → charting | `classifyIvService` / `isIvService` — `worker/src/zenoti/iv-mapping.ts`; `fetchZenotiIvAppointments` — `fetch-browser.ts` | "IV -" prefix; classifies `kind` (standard/addon/pc/custom/ebo) + `weber` + `templateHint`. Add-ons append to the base IV note; PC variants → "Phosphatidylcholine Infusion". Synced to `iv_sessions` via `/api/worker/iv-sessions` (runner `worker/scripts/zenoti-iv-sync.ts`); powers the `/labs/iv` board. Shares `fetchZenotiApptRows` with the lab fetch — don't fork the setDate transport. |
| PC infusion # ("their 30th") — own it, don't ask PB each time | Local ledger `iv_infusion_series` (`zenoti_guest_id`, `series`, `last_number`, `seeded`); assigned at claim time in `/api/worker/iv-post/next` (`assignPcInfusionNumber`, atomic guarded increment); seeded ONCE per patient from PB by the worker `seedPcSeries` pass (`iv-autopost-loop.ts`) via `/api/worker/iv-pc-history`. | Replaced the old "parse the patient's last PB note title +1" enrich — which was racy (drain posted before the enrich stamped a #, so PC notes posted as bare "Phosphatidylcholine Infusion") and fragile (free-text title parsing). Now: number owned locally, assigned the moment before posting, persisted to `iv_sessions.pc_infusion_number` so re-posts reuse it (no double-increment). `post-drain` HOLDS a PC auto-post whose # is still null (patient not yet seeded) rather than posting unnumbered; the seed pass runs BEFORE the drain so a just-synced patient is bootstrapped→numbered→posted in one cycle. Bootstrap all patients at once: `IV_SEED_COMMIT=1 npx tsx worker/scripts/iv-enrich-pc-history.ts`. Health check: `iv-verify-ledger.ts`. Shared PB-read seed logic = `worker/src/iv/pc-series.ts` (`readPbInfusionSeed`, used by loop + CLI — don't re-inline it). A staff-entered # on the chart form is authoritative and SYNCS the ledger (`assignPcInfusionNumber` upserts to it). A weak/ambiguous PB match is NOT seeded → the post HOLDS (staff set the # on the form) rather than auto-posting a wrong "#1". The form shows the next # as a placeholder, never baked into the saved chart (so two pending sessions can't both save the same #). |
| Apply a migration / run prod SQL (no DB password here) | `POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/<ref>/database/query` with `{query}`, Bearer = studio session JWT | No `supabase` CLI / `DATABASE_URL` in this repo, and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (PostgREST) can't run DDL. With a logged-in supabase.com dashboard tab, read the gotrue `access_token` from its `localStorage` and POST SQL to the Mgmt API v1 query endpoint (201 = ok). Used to apply `20260609_iv_sessions.sql`. ref=`oohgjlatfkdckopmbpcc`. |
| Step 1 ("Sample sent") — who ticks it | Entering a tracking # does NOT tick step 1 (decoupled 2026-06-09). It moves the card to **Ready to ship** (`getColumnFor` → `ready_to_ship` when `tracking_number && !step1`). Step 1 ticks ONLY on: a FedEx scan (`refresh-core` on PU/in_transit/delivered, `refreshTrackingForCase` on delivered) or a manual toggle. | A tracking # = a printed return label, NOT proof the package left the clinic — that's the "Ready to ship" lane (and the only pickup-candidate set). The cron poller selects by `tracking_number` regardless of step 1, so ready-to-ship cards still get polled and auto-advance on the pickup scan. Don't re-add an auto-tick to `updateLabCase`/`attachTrackingFromScan` (backlog #2). |
| Edit many of a patient's labs at once | `ManageLabsButton` grid — `src/app/labs/PatientLabManager.tsx` | Patient cards group by **email**; a shared-email family needs the Who-column/per-person scoping. |
| Resolve a same-accession order across cards | `accessionSiblingIds` — `src/lib/labs/siblings.ts` | One physical order split into N cards (Vibrant Zoomer etc.). The approve/disapprove/already-on-PB cascades AND now manual step toggles (`setStepCompleted({cascadeSiblings})`, on by default in `StepChecklist`) move the whole group together so one card never orphans. The kanban "Merge dupes" view collapses the group into ONE card in its most-advanced column (cross-column) — no ghost left behind. |
| Census-driven Zenoti delete reconciliation | route `src/app/api/worker/cases/route.ts` (`syncedDates` + `RECONCILE_GRACE_MS`); **prod loop `worker/scripts/zenoti-auto-loop.ts`** | The reconcile pass only fires if the loop POSTs a COMPLETE per-day census. The dev loop (`zenoti-sync-loop.ts`) always did; the Fly `zenoti` process runs `zenoti-auto-loop.ts`, which used to send NEITHER cancellations NOR a census (and bailed on empty days) — so hard-deletes never synced. Fixed: fetch `includeCancelled: true`, send `cancelledAppointmentIds` + `syncedDates` every tick. |
| Group a patient's labs into drawn-together batches | `groupByDate` — `src/lib/columns.ts` (sibling of `groupByPatient`) | Patients draw 2–7 labs in one sitting; shared `collection_date` = one box. Used by the By-patient card's "By date" toggle and `mergeCasesByDate`. Don't re-bucket dates elsewhere. |
| Merge patients / merge a draw onto one date | `mergePatients` + `mergeCasesByDate` — `src/app/labs/actions.ts` (By-patient select mode) | `mergePatients` reassigns a case-id set onto one identity (identity-only, mirrors `updatePatientAcrossCases`); `mergeCasesByDate` is a thin wrapper over `bulkUpdatePatientCases`. The board's "⊕ Merge dupes" is a separate *view-only* collapse in `LabKanbanBoard`. |
| Find a result with no accession | probe — `POST /probe/:lab?name=` (`worker/src/server.ts`) → `probeCaseResult` (`src/app/labs/probe-actions.ts`) | Scrapes the portal by patient name; empty = "not ready yet". The modern replacement for the dead lab-adapters. |
| Read/patch prod case state from a script | debug endpoint `GET/PATCH /api/worker/debug/cases` (Bearer `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET`) | Worker scripts (`worker/scripts/*`) talk to prod through this, not Supabase directly. Actions: archive, soft/hard-delete, set-collection-date, advance-step1, advance-step5. |
| Poll FedEx + advance/predict | `refreshTrackingForActiveCasesCore` — `src/lib/tracking/refresh-core.ts` | Cron-or-button. Advances on in_transit (not pre_transit) and on delivered (which also predicts result dates). FedEx code PU (picked up) counts as in_transit. |
| Ready-to-ship / pickup state | `isReadyToShip` / `awaitingPickup` / `pickupPending` — `src/lib/labs/pickup.ts` (one source of truth, also drives `getColumnFor`'s `ready_to_ship` lane). | `isReadyToShip = tracking_number && !step1_sample_sent`. `awaitingPickup` = that + no pickup booked (the Schedule-pickup candidates). `pickupPending` = booked but not yet scanned (TrackingBoard "Pending pickup" column). **Key:** key off `step1`, NOT `tracking_status` — FedEx purges history to "unknown", which made already-sent cards + kit-out tracking#s look ready (the "Schedule pickup (109)/(20)" bug). One Book click = ONE FedEx API call, stamps only selected cards; button locks after success. |
| Run the result pipeline | Fly `[processes]` loops in `worker/fly.toml`: `scrape` (scrape-all --loop → stage PDFs), `pbdrain` (post APPROVED PDFs to PB), `tracking`, `zenoti`. | Background jobs MUST be a supervised `[processes]` loop or they don't run. A code path existing ≠ scheduled (scrape-all + pb-drain + refresh-tracking were all built but unscheduled for weeks). After adding a process group, `fly deploy` then confirm it's in `fly scale show`. |
| Which cases are scrapeable | `/api/worker/open-cases` — accession set + (results received OR in result-window) + not on PB. | The scraper matches by accession only (patient-safe), so probing an in-window not-yet-ready case is a safe no-op; `postResultReady` auto-marks step4 when a PDF is found. |
| Activity-log line for a LabEvent | `humanizeEvent` / `isMajorEvent` — `src/lib/labs/humanize-event.ts` | One place maps every `LabEvent` kind (incl. synthetic `audit_*`) to plain English + a major/minor flag. `ActivityLog` routes through it and defaults to major-only (routine FedEx polls/skips collapse behind "Show minor activity"). Add new kinds here, not in the component. Field diffs (`case_edited` meta.changes) relabel snake_case columns via `FIELD_LABEL`. |
| Notify staff a complete result hit PB (step 5) | `notifyCompleteUpload` — `src/lib/workflow.ts` → `sendCompleteUploadNotice` (`src/lib/email/digests.ts`) | Single gate called from every step-5 flip path (worker `pb-upload/result`, manual `complete_uploaded` email, "already on PB"). Deduped on a `complete_upload_notified` lab_event flag — no schema change, same trick as the RoF-reminder cooldown. Reuses the digest `dispatchInternal`. |
| Manually re-probe a stuck Pending-Upload card | `FindResultButton` with `idleLabel`/`busyLabel` — `src/app/labs/FindResultButton.tsx`; surfaced by the "No result staged yet" banner in `CaseDetail.tsx` (gated `pending_upload` + no staged PDF) | Don't fork the probe. The accession-less "Find result" and the #6 "search for lab to post" are the SAME button — only the copy differs. |
| Position / add fields on a req-form template | Calibrate visually — drag fields in `ReqFormCalibrator.tsx`; positions + user-added custom fields persist via `req-forms/overrides.ts` (`{fields, custom}` JSON in the templates bucket) and `fillReqForm` merges them over `specs.ts`. | Don't hand-tune coords in `specs.ts` by eyeballing previews, and don't add a field type for every missing box — the calibrator's "+ Add field" lets staff drop+label+type their own. SVG `<text>` is anchored at its alphabetic baseline = pdf-lib's `drawText` anchor, so the overlay is WYSIWYG. ⚠️ pdf.js: load via NATIVE dynamic import (`new Function("u","return import(u)")`) of the self-hosted **legacy** build at `/pdfjs/pdf.min.js` — letting the app bundler re-process `pdfjs-dist` throws "Object.defineProperty called on non-object". `/pdfjs/` (copied by `copy-pdf-worker` prebuild/predev) is excluded from the auth proxy. Overrides are live; bake settled numbers back into `specs.ts`. Per-form `dateSep` spaces date digits to clear MM/DD/YYYY divider boxes. The req's order/sample # comes from the case's `lab_external_ref` (the "Accession #" field) for every mode in `resolve.ts` — manual (Kennedy) reads it directly, assign (DoctorsData) only synthesizes `DD-<tracking>` when blank. Calibrate without a case from **Settings → Req forms** (`ReqFormsPanel.tsx`); the calibrator takes `source: {caseId} | {templateKey}`. |
| Re-check an Access partial for completion | `partialCompletionCheckDue` — `src/lib/labs/catalog.ts`; gated in `open-cases` (Access feed only). | Access drips a partial (step2) then back-fills the complete panel over ~2wk. Don't re-scrape every hourly loop — re-check only ~day 2, day 4–7, day 14+ after the partial PDF arrived (anchor = latest non-superseded `is_partial` `attached_at`). Open-ended past day 14 so a late complete is still pulled. No new scheduler — it narrows the existing feed. |
| Dismiss a hand-rolled dropdown/popover | `useDismiss(ref, open, onDismiss)` — `src/app/labs/use-dismiss.ts` | One hook for outside-click AND Escape close (Escape is preventDefault-ed so it won't also cancel an enclosing `<dialog>`). Used by the kanban `SortControl`, `ContactAttemptButton`, `CaseCard` menu, `PatientPicker`, `LabCombobox` — don't re-wire `document.addEventListener("mousedown", …)` inline again. |
| EDIT an already-posted PB labrequest (title / Date Ordered) | `worker/scripts/pb-labrequest-edit-test.ts` — `PUT /api/consultant/labrequests/{id}` with a minimal create-shaped body | VERIFIED 2026-06-11 (fixed 3 live notes). Gotchas: the labrequests surface REJECTS `x-api-version` (425) — plain `pbApiHeaders` only (sessionnotes is the opposite); send a MINIMAL body (the GET embeds huge consultant/clientRecord blobs); always `notify:false` on edits (never re-invite the patient); dates as `T12:00:00.000Z` noon UTC or PB's Eastern rendering shows the previous day. |
| Post an inbox email's PDF to a case / PB | `postInboundToPb` — `src/app/labs/inbox/actions.ts` ("Post to PB" / "New case + Post to PB" buttons) | Re-fetches the PDF BYTES from Gmail (sync stores only extracted text), stages through `uploadResultPdf` (auto-approve → PB queue). `createCase` path inherits email/DOB from the patient's existing cases (boards group by email) and sets `collection_date` from the Claude parse so PB's Date Ordered is right. `reparseInboundEmail` re-runs extraction+parse+match for failed rows. |

## The 7 portal scrapers (don't add an 8th pattern — copy one)
Built via the recipe engine (`worker/src/recipes/`) or hand-written. All
verified byte-equivalent. To add a portal: `/lab-portal-capture` skill →
HAR capture → recipe. Gotcha index lives in each capture folder + the memory.
Portals: Access, Cyrex, Spectracell, Genova, GlycanAge, DoctorsData, Vibrant.

## Dead code — do NOT extend
- `src/lib/lab-adapters/` (LabCorp/Quest) — the old "pull status" system. The
  real portals have worker scrapers + the probe. The "Refresh lab status"
  button is only meaningful if `getAdapterFor` returns non-null.

## Operational gotchas (bit us before)
- **Worker scripts hit PROD** (`.env.local` → `TRACKER_BASE_URL` = Vercel). A
  localhost dev server also reads `.env.local` → talks to prod Supabase.
- **FedEx is prod-only**: keys live in Vercel, not `.env.local`; Vercel cron
  doesn't run locally. Test FedEx on the deployed app.
- **Vercel is on Hobby** → crons run **once/day max**. For higher cadence,
  schedule from the Fly worker (no plan cap) hitting the cron endpoint.
- **Root `tsconfig.json` must exclude `worker/`** or Vercel builds break.
- Multi-panel Zenoti tests (Vibrant Zoomer) arrive as N services → N cards
  sharing one kit/accession. That's expected, not a duplicate.
- **pdf.js breaks when bundled — SERVER too.** `pdf-parse` v2 wraps
  `pdfjs-dist`; Turbopack re-processing it throws "Object.defineProperty
  called on non-object" on every parse (the same trap as the client
  calibrator). Fix: `serverExternalPackages: ["pdf-parse", "pdfjs-dist"]` in
  next.config.ts. Also: pdf-parse v2 is a CLASS API (`new
  PDFParse({data}).getText()`) — the v1-style `default(buffer)` call throws.
- **pdf.js works on localhost but breaks DEPLOYED** ("DOMMatrix is not
  defined"): pdfjs loads `@napi-rs/canvas` via createRequire and
  `pdf.worker.mjs` via a variable dynamic import — both invisible to Vercel's
  file tracer, so neither ships with the function. Fix:
  `outputFileTracingIncludes` for the canvas package (next.config.ts) + a
  literal `import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.worker.mjs")` in
  extract-pdf.ts. Verify with `.next/server/**/*.nft.json`, and NEVER swallow
  per-attachment errors (sync surfaces them in `parser_error` now). To test
  the whole inbox pipeline end-to-end: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local
  scripts/send-mock-lab-email.ts` (mock PDF → Resend → labs@ → Gmail sync),
  and `scripts/diagnose-inbound-attachment.ts <gmailMessageId>` to replay one
  message's attachment path locally with errors visible.
- **`.kanban-col` has `overflow: hidden`** (hud.css, for the rounded gradient
  columns) — any `position: absolute` popover inside a column gets CLIPPED at
  the column edge, and the columns are narrower than a typical menu. Use the
  `SortControl` pattern: `position: fixed` from the anchor's
  `getBoundingClientRect()` + `useDismiss` (which closes on outside scroll so
  the fixed menu can't drift). Also: grep the WHOLE repo for a CSS selector
  (`hud.css`, not just `globals.css`) and render-verify UI changes in Chrome —
  tsc/build can't catch visual clipping.
